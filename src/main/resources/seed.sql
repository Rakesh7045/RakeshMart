-- Product/category seed data.
-- NOTE: Seed USERS (admin/seller/buyer) are inserted at application startup by
-- SeedDataInitializer (listener package) using jBCrypt at runtime, so real
-- bcrypt hashes are always generated correctly rather than hardcoded here.
-- This file only seeds non-sensitive demo product data, inserted after users exist.

-- Run manually against a fresh DB (after the app has started once and seeded users),
-- or adapt seller_id values to match your seeded seller's actual id.
